            The person you see on the right (desktop) or at the top (mobile) — yeah, that’s me. An IT graduate who somehow managed to complete four years of engineering without ever really *engineering* anything. Out of the 100 things I loved in life, computers proudly held the last spot.  
<br/><br/>
Back in school, I was busy solving calculus problems while my classmates were solving Visual Basic errors. My idea of coding was... not coding.  
<br/><br/>
After 4 years of “enjoying life” and living it to the fullest, I stepped into the real world — and let’s just say, it doesn’t hand out medals for good memories. I had ambition, yes, but no clear focus. Every time the road got tough, I’d quietly take the exit ramp and jump on a new boat.  
<br/><br/>
It took a few faceplants and hard lessons to realize I’d become the perfect target for life’s roundhouse kicks. So I decided to toughen up — physically, mentally, emotionally. And right when I was rebuilding myself, I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 font-bold">The Primeagen</a> on YouTube — zipping around a terminal like a wizard. Vim, tmux, shortcuts flying left and right — I didn’t understand a thing, but I knew one thing: "I wanted that".  
<br/><br/>
So, I partitioned my drive, installed <span class="text-blue-500 font-bold">Ubuntu</span>, and boom — the fire was lit.  
What started with Linux turned into a full-blown tech obsession. One curiosity led to another — from Linux → data structures → databases → development → and eventually, the rabbit hole of Computer Engineering.  
<br/><br/>
Fast forward to today — I’m working in the world of agentic AI systems, deployment pipelines, and bridging the gap between models and real-world applications. I’m now the kind of person who gets anxious *not* when sitting at a computer — but when I’m away from it.  
<br/><br/>
This is my year one of a multi-year journey where I'm mastering the craft of <span class="text-blue-500 font-bold">AI Engineering</span>  
and building impactful projects that solve real problems.
<br/><br/>
When I’m not wrangling models or debugging APIs, I’m dreaming about jumping out of a plane (with a parachute, of course), climbing peaks that test my limits, and building a life where freedom, creation, and purpose co-exist.  
<br/><br/>
This portfolio is my corner of the internet — where I share what I learn, what I build, and what I believe in. It’s not just about code. It’s about <span class="text-blue-500 font-bold">becoming</span>.
